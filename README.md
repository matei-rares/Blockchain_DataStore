#### This is a web application designed to obtain technical information about a car such as the number of kilometers or the width of the wheels as well as information about its history such as accidents, modifications, service, all this in a transparent and reliable manner ensured by the nodes of a blockchain. The main idea is not that of security, but of consistency.
#### The project uses Angular for a graphical interface intended for a regular end user, the Ganache application to save the state of the blockchain, Solidity to manage the data in the blockchain and Flask to separate but still facilitate the communication between the services of the application. (e.g. one additional service is one of neuronal networks that analyze the history of a car and try to determine if it went through a crash)
